Image Data analysis from OSNs
Paris attacks mainly
Contrasts b/w image data and text data
Less studies on images till now:
	Either small datasets and mannual process
	Or On text data
A. Data Collection
	#tags --> Posts containing images --> Removal of duplicates (dHash)
B. Image Characterization
	3 Tier pipeline:
	1. Theme detection. No fine tuning. Similar images give similar results
	2. OCR -> Pytessaract
	3. Sentiment detection. (using SentiBank)
C. Analysis
	Many images misinformed
	Text gave more positive sentiment than images

- Many points of misinterpretition could be there. Human involvement for verification
- Amused that we can almost tell a story from images.
